    b. one or more student answer sheets in the same format as key sheet
2. It compares all the student answer sheets with the key sheet
3. Writes the score on the respective student's answer sheet. 

For the purpose of Hackathon, we do not want you to build a GUI for this application. Only the core module which can compare the
