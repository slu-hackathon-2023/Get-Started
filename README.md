# Hackathon

## Title: Build an automated Scantron Grading Software

### Problem:
Currently, grading multiple choice exams that use Scantron answer sheets (OMR sheets) is a manual, tedious, and time-consuming process. Teachers must use a separate Scantron device to read the key answer sheet and each student's answer sheet to calculate grades. This takes a significant amount of time and effort.

### Objective:
Develop a software application that automatically grades student's answer sheets by comparing their answers to the key answer sheet, calculating a score, and writing that score digitally onto the student's answer sheet.

### Requirements:

**Input**  

The software must accept the following inputs:
1. Key Answer Sheet: Single page image OR single page scanned PDF (one format must be chosen)
2. Student Answer Sheets: Same file format as key answer sheet, multiple sheets allowed

**Grading Capability**
1. Software must compare each student answer sheet to the key answer sheet
2. Software must calculate a grade/score and digitally write that score onto the respective student's answer sheet

|Sample input Key|  Sample Input Student sheet | Sample Output|
|---|---|---|

**Scope**
1. Core grading module only with the capabilities outlined in the requirements
2. Graphical user interface (GUI) is not required

### Deliverables

Software application meeting the above requirements and objectives that automatically grades Scantron bubble answer sheets.

**Important Information**

Given the short 2 hour timeframe, we understand that you may not be able to build a polished, production-ready solution. Rather, we want to evaluate your approach, architecture, and progress towards a proof-of-concept that could solve this problem.

We want to mainly see,
- A proposed Technical Architecture with high-level plan for how you would design/architect the automated grading system (Key components, modules, flows, etc.)
- Based on your architecture, begin building the core grading functionality
    - Focus on the key algorithms for parsing/comparing answer sheets and scoring
    - Pseudocode or stubs are acceptable where you cannot complete full functionality
- In a Readme file,
    - Explain your architecture and design decisions
    - Identify areas of difficulty and how you would resolve if you had more time

Again, We want to evaluate how well you are able to analyze the problem, architect a solution, make progress on core functionality, and clearly present your approach.
